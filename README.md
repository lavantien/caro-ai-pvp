Mobile-first web arena for a custom 16x16 caro variant: exact continuous five wins, overlines never win, both-ends close-blocked lines are dead, and red's second move needs Chebyshev distance >= 3 from the first. Play from a phone browser against a person or an increment-safe bot on server-hosted rooms, watch live rooms as a guest, step through match history with a playback board, and run bot vs bot tournaments on the same room surface with per-move engine telemetry and a decay-scaled rating. The v0.20 behavior contract is scenario 1 in [first-cause.md](first-cause.md).

## grounding

- [first-cause.md](first-cause.md): the founding spec, rules, hardware budget, and v0.20 scenarios.
- [docs/plans/first-cause-rebuild.md](docs/plans/first-cause-rebuild.md): milestone plan for the rebuild, updated as milestones land.
- ref/: offline chessprogramming.org and gomocup grounding, browser-sourced.

## build and verify

Requires go 1.27.1+, gcc, GNU make, with CGO enabled.

```
make doctor   # toolchain check: go >= 1.27.1, CGO, gcc
make ci       # fmt-check, vet, build, race tests, coverage gates
```

Coverage gates: 95% overall, 100% on internal/rules, internal/engine, and internal/clock.

## status

- v0.1 (M0..M4): rules core at 100% with zero surviving mutants, init-computed pattern tables, zero-alloc PVS+ID+TT search, lazy SMP tiers, VCF/VCT solvers with a brute-force soundness oracle.
- v0.2 (M5): increment-safe time manager, one tuned PID gain set per time control, soft-stop wiring with the Windows clock-quantum guard, mutation gate green at 1573/1573 over rules+engine+clock with 79 challenge-audited equivalence allowances.
- v0.3 (M6a part 1): server foundation, SQLite WAL store with forward-only self-migration, per-match rating law, series state machine (loser-takes-red, forfeit-as-losses), single-writer mutation queue, room stats pub-sub hub, argon2id login-or-create, zero-alloc M-line emitter.
